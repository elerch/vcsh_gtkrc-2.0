KNOWN BUGS:
===========

 - OpenOffice and most other Gtk apps have a different base and text color than the rest of the theme.
   This is anavoidable if you want to have a usable OpenOffice. If you want to have a unified look, you
   can make all Gtk apps follow the same settings by setting the Input Boxes background color to 5C5C5C
   and the Input Boxes text color to ECECEC.
